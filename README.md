<h3> About the Competition </h3>
<p> FTC is the biggest robotics competition for highschool students in the world. Each year a new game with new rules is released and your team has to design, build and program a robot to accomplish certain tasks. </p>

<h3> About the Project</h3>
<p> An SDK is available which is used to communicate with the hardware on the robot. Using this SDK you have to program the robot's system depending on your needs. All the code we wrote is in the folder "TeamCode".</p>
